# QUIZ SHELL

This is a simple quiz to practice my shell scripting. I decided to make a quiz so that I could use it to write my own questions and answers. I know there are other resources for that already, but it's more fun when you write one yourself!

## How to use quiz shell

### Create your quiz file

Make a text file in the **quiz_keys** folder with the name of your quiz. The question and answer **must** be on the same line and separated with a pipe(|). Refer to the bash quiz I have included for the format. **Do not** put leading or trailing spaces in your answers. If you do, they must be typed in your answer as well or it will be counted incorrectly.

Example

```text
this is my first question|this is my answer
```

**If you find any bug please create an issue.**
